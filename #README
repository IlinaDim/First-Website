# First-Website

Welcome to **First-Website**!  
This project was created as the final assignment for my CISC 1400 Discrete Structures class, and it marked my very first experience building a website with HTML. I wanted to make the project both fun and meaningful, so I designed it around personal stories and interests. This not only helped me learn HTML more easily but also made the process truly enjoyable.

## Project Purpose

- **Educational Goal:**  
  Created to practice and demonstrate foundational HTML and CSS skills learned during the course.
- **Personal Touch:**  
  The site is a reflection of myself, my interests, and the things important to meâ€”including my brother and my cat!
- **Creative Learning:**  
  By making the website personal, I found it easier and more fun to explore and understand web development basics.

##Inside

The site consists of several pages, each embedded or linked together:

- **index.html:**  
  The homepage, introducing myself and displaying images, video, and links to the other pages.
- **page1.html:**  
  A playlist of favorite songs I like to listen to while painting or writing.
- **page2.html:**  
  A favorite song, complete with an image and audio player.
- **page3.html:**  
  An interactive quiz about funny moments with my brother and cat.
- **page4.html:**  
  A page about my favorite book and why it means so much to me.
- **page5.html:**  
  A page highlighting a fan-made story that inspired me to write my own.

All multimedia content (images, audio, video) is stored in the `/media` folder.

## How to Run

1. **Clone or download** this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
3. Click around and enjoy exploring the different pages!

> **Note:** For full functionality (images, audio, video), ensure the `/media` folder is present and contains the relevant files.
